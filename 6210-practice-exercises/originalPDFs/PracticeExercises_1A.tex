\exercise{1A}{
A deck of cards has 52 total cards: \{A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\}\\ in each of 4 suits: \{diamonds $\diamondsuit$, hearts $\heartsuit$, spades $\spadesuit$, clubs $\clubsuit$\}.

Diamonds and hearts are red, spades and clubs are black.

You randomly draw 1 card from the deck. Define:\\
$A$ = event that the card is a king (K)\\
$B$ = event that the card is a ``face card" (J, Q, or K)\\
$C$ = event that the card is ``red" (either hearts or diamonds)

(a) What is the complement of $C$?

\answer{1.5cm}{card is black (``not red")}

(b) Are any of these events disjoint?

\answer{1.5cm}{no}

(c) Is $A$ a subset of $B$ or $B$ a subset of $A$?

\answer{1.5cm}{A a subset of B}

(d) What is $A \cap B$?

\answer{1.5cm}{card is a king (event A)}

(e) How many outcomes (cards) are in $A \cap B \cap C$?

\answer{0.1cm}{$A \cap B \cap C$ = ``red king" = \{$\diamondsuit$K, $\heartsuit$K\} = 2 possible outcomes}
}
