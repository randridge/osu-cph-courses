\exercise{2C}{
Suppose scores on a certain standardized test are normalized so that they follow the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.

(a) What is the probability that a randomly selected exam taker gets a score greater than 2?

\answer{2cm}{ANSWER: 0.0228\\
~\\[-5pt]
$P(Z>2) = 0.0228$ (Normal Table, Column B)}

(b) What is the probability that a randomly selected exam taker gets a score lower than than -3.5?

\answer{3cm}{ANSWER: 0.0002\\
~\\[-5pt]
$P(Z<-3.5)=P(Z>3.5)=0.0002$ (Column B)}

(c) What is the probability that a randomly selected exam taker gets a score between -1 and +1?

\answer{3cm}{ANSWER: 0.6826\\
~\\[-5pt]
$P(-1 < Z < 1) = P(Z<1) - P(Z<-1) $\\
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$= P(Z<1) - P(Z>1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826$ (Columns A and B)}

(d) What is the probability that a randomly selected exam taker gets a score either greater than 2 or less than -2?

\answer{3cm}{ANSWER: 0.0456\\
~\\[-5pt]
$P(Z<-2 \text{ OR } Z>2)=P(Z<-2) + P(Z>2) $\\
\qquad\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$= P(Z>2)+P(Z>2)=2 \times P(Z>2)=2 \times 0.0228=0.0456$}}
