# Exercise 1

While visiting the Three Bears' house, Goldilocks finds three bowls of porridge. Upon tasting a bowl she will declare it either Too Hot, Too Cold, or Just Right. How many possible outcomes are there?

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 27

$n=3$ bowls tasted

$k=3$ possible outcomes for each bowl.

Total number of outcomes = $k^n = 3^3 = 27$

# Exercise 2

We have 4 imaging modalities available for diagnosing a brain tumor: CT, MRI, MRS, PET.

(a) If all four modalities have to be used, in how many different orders can the physician request them?

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 24 

$n=4$ modalities

&#35; of ways to order = $n! = 4! = 24$

:::

(b) Suppose that only three modalities are used and if they all agree, the patient will be considered positive for a brain tumor.  How many different combinations of the three chosen modalities can the physician use?

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 4

$n=4$ modalities

$k=3$ chosen without regard to order

&#35; of ways = $\displaystyle _nC_k = {n \choose k} = {4 \choose 3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4$

:::

(c) How many different sequences (orderings) of three modalities could the physician order?  

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 24

$n=4$ modalities

$k=3$ chosen **with** regard to order

&#35; of ways = $\displaystyle _nP_k = {_4}P_3 = \frac{4!}{(4-3)!} = 24$

# Exercise 3

A pair of (standard, six-sided) dice are rolled. Let $A$ be the event that the first die is a 6 and $B$ be the event that the second die is a 6.

(a) Calculate $P(A \cap B)$.

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 1/36

$A \cap B$ = 6 on first roll and 6 on second roll

Each roll has $k=6$ outcomes and we are repeating the experiment $n=2$ times

Total number of outcomes = $k^n = 6^2 = 36$

Total number of outcomes associated with the event of interest = 1 (\{6,6\})

$P(A \cap B)=1/36$
:::

(b) Calculate $P(A \cup B)$.

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 11/36 

$P(A) = P(\text{6 on first roll}) = 1/6$

$P(B) = P(\text{6 on second roll}) = 1/6$

$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 1/6 + 1/6 - 1/36 = 11/36$

# Exercise 4

A social scientist is recruiting adults who have either diabetes or asthma to participate in a pilot study investigating strategies for managing chronic disease. She will cold-call adults in Columbus, Ohio to recruit study subjects. In Ohio, 6.8% of adults have asthma, 10.5% of adults have diabetes, and 0.8%  of adults have both.

(a) What is the probability that a randomly called adult will be eligible for her study?

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.165

$A$ = subject has asthma, $P(A) = 0.068$

$B$ = subject has diabetes, $P(B) = 0.105$

$A \cap B$ = subject has asthma and diabetes, $P(A \cap B) = 0.008$

"eligible" = has asthma OR diabetes = $P(A \cup B)$

$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.068 + 0.105 - 0.008 = 0.165$
:::

(b) What is the probability that a randomly called adult will not be eligible for her study?

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.835

"not eligible" = complement of "eligible" = $(A \cup B)^C$

$P((A \cup B)^C) = 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - 0.165 = 0.835$

# Exercise 5

Suppose there are two tests for a disease, test G and test H. In the whole population, test G gives a positive result 20% of the time and test H gives a positive result 30% of the time. Test G and test H both give a positive result 10% of the time.

(a) What is the probability of either test G or test H being positive?

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.4

$P(G) = 0.2$

$P(H) = 0.3$

$P(G \cap H) = 0.1$

$P(G \cup H) = P(G) + P(H) - P(G \cap H) = 0.2 + 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.4$
:::

(b) What is the probability of test G being negative and test H being positive? (A Venn Diagram may be useful\dots)

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.2

We want "H and not G", which in the Venn diagram is shaded:

![A Venn Diagram](./figures/1B5.png){fig-alt="A Venn diagram consisting of two overlapping circles labeled G and H. Circle G is on the left and circle H is on the right. Only the portion of circle H that does not overlap with circle G is filled with diagonal pink stripes. The circle G and the intersection of the two circles are white/unshaded." width=40%}

$P(H \cap G^C) = P(H) - P(G \cap H)$  (all of H, minus the intersection with G)

$P(H \cap G^C) = 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2$

# Exercise 6

CHALLENGE: In Texas Hold 'Em poker, each player makes the strongest hand he can with 5 cards. Strength of the hand is based on the probability of that specific combination of 5 cards. How likely is four of a kind? ("four of a kind" = 4 cards all the same &#35;, plus 1 other card) Note that there are 52 cards in a standard deck.

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.00024

Number of possible hands of 5 cards = ${52 \choose 5} = 2598960$

Number of ways to have a hand with 4 of same &#35;, plus one other card 

 = (&#35; of ways to have 4 of same &#35;) $\times$ (&#35; of ways to select the other card, i.e., not one of those 4)

 = $13 \times (52-4) = 13 \times 48 = 624$

$P(\text{4 of a kind}) = 624 / 2598960 = 0.00024$
