# Exercise 1

A small sample of undergraduate students was randomly selected from a chemistry course. Their GPAs were recorded and are shown below. Use these data to calculate the requested summary measures.

GPAs: 3.08, 2.5, 3.33, 3.75, 3.1, 2.64

(a) Standard deviation

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.456

Mean: $\bar{x}=3.07$ (calculated in Practice Exercise 3B #2)

| $x_i$ | $x_1-\bar{x}$ | $(x_i-\bar{x})^2$ |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 3.08  | 0.01          | 0.0001            |
| 2.5   | -0.57         | 0.3249            |
| 3.33  | 0.26          | 0.0676            |
| 3.75  | 0.68          | 0.4624            |
| 3.1   | 0.03          | 0.0009            |
| 2.64  | -0.43         | 0.1849            |

: table showing calculations

The sum of the values in the last column = 1.0408 

Divide by 5 to get $s^2$: 1.0408/5 = 0.208 

Take square root to get $s$: $s=\sqrt{s^2}=\sqrt{0.208}$ = 0.456 

:::

(b) Coefficient of variation

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 0.149

Mean: $\bar{x}=3.07$ (calculated in Practice Exercise 3B #2)

Standard deviation: $s=0.456$ (part (a) above)

$\displaystyle cv = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}=\frac{0.456}{3.07}=0.149$
:::

(c) 75th percentile

::: {.answer .hidden}
ANSWER: 3.33

Sort data values: 2.5, 2.64, 3.08, 3.1, 3.33, 3.75

$nk/100 = 6\times75/100 = 4.5$ = not an integer, so round up to next integer $\rightarrow$ 5

5th observation (in order) = 3.33
