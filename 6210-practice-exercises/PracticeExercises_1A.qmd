# Exercise 1

A deck of cards has 52 total cards: \{A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\}\\ in each of 4 suits: \{diamonds $\diamondsuit$, hearts $\heartsuit$, spades $\spadesuit$, clubs $\clubsuit$\}.

Diamonds and hearts are red, spades and clubs are black.

You randomly draw 1 card from the deck. Define:

$A$ = event that the card is a king (K)

$B$ = event that the card is a "face card" (J, Q, or K)

$C$ = event that the card is "red" (either hearts or diamonds)

(a) What is the complement of $C$?

::: {.answer .hidden}
card is black ("not red")
:::

(b) Are any of these events disjoint?

::: {.answer .hidden}
no
:::

(c) Is $A$ a subset of $B$ or $B$ a subset of $A$?

::: {.answer .hidden}
A a subset of B
:::

(d) What is $A \cap B$?

::: {.answer .hidden}
card is a king (event A)
:::

(e) How many outcomes (cards) are in $A \cap B \cap C$?

::: {.answer .hidden}
$A \cap B \cap C$ = "red king" = \{$\diamondsuit$K, $\heartsuit$K\} = 2 possible outcomes
